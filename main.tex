\section{3 Idiots}
\subsection{Summary}
Two friends embark on a quest for a lost buddy. On this journey, they encounter a long forgotten bet, a wedding they must crash, and a funeral that goes impossibly out of control. As they make their way through the perilous landscape, another journey begins: their inner journey through memory lane and the story of their friend--the irrepressible free-thinker Rancho, who in his unique way, touched and changed their lives. It’s a story of their hostel days that swings between Rancho’s romance with the spirited Pia, and his clash with an oppressive mentor, Viru Sahastrabudhhe . And then one day, suddenly, Rancho is gone.

\subsection{Review}
3 Idiots is a coming-age comedy and inspirational film directed by Rajkumar Hirani. The story of the film is similar to that of the famous novel Five Point Someone by Chetan Bhagat. This film is based on our Indian educational system which pressurizes the students and has an obsession for high grades.  Aamir Khan as Rancho plays the role of a very bright student who motivates his friends pursue their passion and make a career out of it. R.Madhavan as Farhan who wants to become a wildlife photographer but was forced to pursue engineering because of his strict father. Sharman Joshi as Raju who is pursuing engineering with the goal of getting his family out of extreme poverty. Boman Irani as 'ViruS' who plays the role of a strict college director who is highly competitive. Kareena Kapoor as Pia who plays the role of virus’s daughter and falls in love with Aamir khan.

The film goes very smooth. The film’s first half includes ragging scene, confrontations with the professor, Chatur’s speech and mournful meal at Raju’s home. Overall the film depicts a very nice mingle of comedy, suspense and motivational. All the actors and co-actors done a commendable job. The music of the film was very soothing. The back ground music supports the film all through the movie. Overall depiction is fine. Some of the scenes are really emotional. Overall rating is excellent.Its definitely a one time watch.
